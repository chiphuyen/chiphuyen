### Hi, I'm Chip 👋

I'm a writer and computer scientist. I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam. I spend a lot of time with chickens and [alpacas](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsjo44ThRRv/).

- 🎓 I teach [Machine Learning Systems Design](https://cs329s.stanford.edu/) at Stanford.
- 🔭 I'm currently building a framework for continual evaluation and deployment of ML.
- 📝 I write a lot! I'm the author of the book [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969) (O'Reilly, 2022). My book on [machine learning interviews][ml-interviews] is open-sourced and free! In a past life, I wrote [four Vietnamese books of stories about people I met around the world][goodreads]. 
- 😅 Fun fact: After high school, I went to Brunei for a 3-day vacation which turned into a 3-year trip through Asia, Africa, and South America. During my trip, I worked as a Bollywood extra, a casino hostess, and a street performer.

I'm best reached via [email](https://huyenchip.com/communication). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
