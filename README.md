### Hi, I'm Chip 👋

I'm a writer and computer scientist. I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam. I spend a lot of time with chickens and alpacas.

- 🔭 I'm currently with [Snorkel AI](https://snorkel.ai), a data-first end-to-end platform for developing AI applications.
- 📝 I write a lot! I'm the author of [four bestselling Vietnamese books][goodreads]. I'm working on an English book on [machine learning interviews][ml-interviews].
- 😅 Fun fact: After high school, I went to Brunei for a 3-day vacation which turned into a 3-year trip through Asia, Africa, and South America. During my trip, I worked as a Bollywood extra, a casino hostess, and a street performer.

Most of my technical work is on this site. Some of my other projects:

- [StanfordIRL](https://stanfordirl.com): chronicle of the amazing things people do after Stanford
- [VietAI](http://vietai.org/): a nonprofit working to educate future AI talent about AI for social good
- [Free Hugs Vietnam][fhv]: a nonprofit that provides soft skills for Vietnamese youths
- Trying to make these [11 cute but kinda rude alpacas love me](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsjo44ThRRv/)

I'm best reached via [email]({{site.url}}/communication). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
