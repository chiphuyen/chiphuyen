### Hi, I'm Chip 👋

I'm a writer and computer scientist. I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam. I spend a lot of time with chickens and [alpacas](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsjo44ThRRv/).

- 🔭 I'm currently doing research on AI for coding, education, and storytelling (all of them are fascinatingly interconnected!)
- 🔨 I build micro tools to make me more productive. Some of them are public like [Sniffly](https://github.com/chiphuyen/sniffly) for Claude Code analysis, [lazynlp](https://github.com/chiphuyen/lazynlp), and [sotawhat](https://github.com/chiphuyen/sotawhat).
- 📝 I write a lot! I'm the author of [AI Engineering](https://amzn.to/3H7RqxJ) and [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://amzn.to/4mlL8cZ). My book on [machine learning interviews][ml-interviews] is open-sourced and free!
- 💖 In a past life, I wrote [four Vietnamese books of stories about people I met around the world][goodreads]. I've recently finished a [novel](https://www.amazon.com/Entanglements-that-never-Alexandria-Song-ebook/dp/B0F1KSDZZL) that is a crossover of Crazy Rich Asians and Game of Thrones (aka strategic thinking in relationships, set in Vietnam 🇻🇳)
- 🎓 I used to [Machine Learning Systems Design](https://cs329s.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, which gave me many ideas on teaching and learning.
- 😅 Fun fact: After high school, I went to Brunei for a 3-day vacation which turned into a 3-year trip through Asia, Africa, and South America. During my trip, I worked as a Bollywood extra, a casino hostess, and a street performer.

I'm best reached via [email](https://huyenchip.com/communication). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
